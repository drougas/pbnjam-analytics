Description
===========
We wanted to create a cool visualization of the data returned by one of the OPEN APIs.

Since our team consists of a good mix of back-end engineers, a front-end engineer, and a UI designer - we wanted to design an application that would consume an API and then visualize the data using using a front-end framework.

We used the Media Analytics API in order to get data on the Report Packs. From there, we created a dashboard to analyze the events that are part of each report pack.
